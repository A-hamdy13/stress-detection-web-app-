# A stress detection web app using GSR, temperature, and heart rate sensors connected using an ESP32 with an AI model trained on the WESAD dataset. Displays live charts of stress, temperature, and heart rate over time.




# Stress Detection Web App

This project combines **wearable sensors** with a **machine learning model** to detect stress in real time.  

### Features
- **Sensors used:**
  - Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (finger electrodes)  
  - Temperature sensor  
  - Heart rate sensor  
- **AI Model:** Trained on the **WESAD dataset** to classify stress vs. non-stress states.  
- **Web App Dashboard:**  
  - Stress level over time  
  - Temperature over time  
  - Heart rate over time  

### Why?
The app explores how physiological signals can be used for stress monitoring and mental health support.  

*Built as an experiment in combining IoT sensors with AI for health-focused applications.*
